# Camel HTTP to Log Tutorial with Endpoint DSL

## Introduction
In this exercise, you will be working with Camel's Endpoint DSL alongside the `platform-http` and `log` components. Endpoint DSL is a type-safe way to configure endpoints, which is an evolution from the URI string-based approach used in the Java DSL. Endpoint DSL provides a more fluent, readable, and auto-completable coding experience. Understanding the Endpoint DSL is essential as it provides a modern and type-safe way to configure endpoints, making your Camel routes more robust and easier to maintain.

- [Camel Endpoint DSL documentation](https://camel.apache.org/manual/latest/Endpoint-dsl.html)
- [Camel Platform-HTTP component documentation](https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/platform-http-component.html)
- [Camel Log component documentation](https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/log-component.html)

## Objective
Your task is to create a Camel route within the provided `configure` method of the `CamelRoute` class, which extends `EndpointRouteBuilder`. This route will expose an HTTP endpoint at `/camel/hello`, which when accessed, responds with a message "Camel HTTP Endpoint DSL" and logs the message, using the Endpoint DSL for configuration.

## Requirements

### 1. **HTTP Endpoint Exposure**:
   - Create a route that starts from an HTTP endpoint with the path `/camel/helloEndpoint` using the `platformHttp` method provided by the Endpoint DSL.
   
### 2. **Message Crafting**:
   - Set the message body to the string "Camel HTTP Endpoint DSL".
   
### 3. **Logging**:
   - Send the message to a log endpoint named `hi`, configured to not show the Exchange Pattern and the Body Type in the log message, using the Endpoint DSL to configure the log endpoint.

            from(platformHttp("/camel/helloEndpoint"))
                .setBody().simple("Camel HTTP Endpoint DSL")
                .to(log("hi").showExchangePattern(false).showBodyType(false));
